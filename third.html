        of matter.this theory was able to explain the law of conservation of mass,

        charge to mass ration of electron was determined by thomason.
        for this, he sujected the beam of electron released in the discharge
        tube as cathode rays under the influence of electric and megnetic filds.
        these were acting perpendicular to one another as well as to the path followed
        by electrones.
